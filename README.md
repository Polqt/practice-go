## Go coding exercises and elegant solutions

### How to solve

 - Each challenge(folder) has a README.md file and `*_test.go` file, check it and find what kind of function you need to implement.
 - You may use anything you want except the 3rd-party packages.
 - Implement the function.
 - Run the tests and benchmarks.
 - Create a PR and answer questions from PR template.
 - We will choose the most fast and elegant solution and merge into the repo.
 - New solutions may come in later and be merged as well if they are: faster, cleaner, have less CPU/Mem footprint

### Run tests with benchmarks

Run it in the challenge folder:

```
go test -bench .
```

### How to contribute

You may suggest other challenges as well, not only of DSA type.

Create a new challenge using this small bash script and create a PR.

```
./new.sh challenge_name
```

The challenge must follow these rules:
- Explain the challenge well in README.md file so it's clear to everyone what needs to be done.
- Cover as much of test cases as possible, edge cases as well so people who solve it can focus on the implementation only.
